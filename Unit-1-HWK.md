# Unit 1 Homework

## What I Have Learnt So Far

- What software development is and what it entails.
- The different careers in software development available such as DevOps engineer.
- Introduced to the software development life cycle (SDLC) and different project management tools.
- Introduced to the principles of agile working and specific frameworks e.g. Scrum and Kanban.
- Learnt the importance of source/version control.
- Introduced to git and git hub.
- Refamiliarised myself with bash commands and how to navigate the command line. I also learnt some new commands that I didn't know before.
- Learnt the essential commands needed to pull and push work on github.

## What I Am Struggling With

- I think I understand the basics of git and git hub but sometimes I struggle with visualising when something is in my local repository vs the main repository.
- I need to take some time to understand what forks are.
- Pull requests 
- I think I just need more practice of using the commands and doing the process to solidify everything.
